# Blizzard-Checkers
This is an archive of my successful 2012, Associate Programmer test for Blizzard Entertainment.

I had a total of 6 hours to program a game of checkers. Features include:

* Sweet ASCII intro
* AI vs AI, AI vs Human, Human vs Human gameplay
* Legal but random moves from the AI
*Single jump captures (doubles and beyond weren't completed)

The entry point for the game can be found in Main.cpp. Enjoy!
