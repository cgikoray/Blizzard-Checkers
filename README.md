# Blizzard-Checkers
This is an archive of my successful 2012, Associate Programmer test for Blizzard Entertainment. 

I had a total of 6 hours to program a game of chess. Features include:
* Sweet ASCII intro
* AI vs AI, AI vs Human, Human vs Human gameplay
* Legal but random moves from the AI
* Single jump captures (doubles and beyond weren't completed)
